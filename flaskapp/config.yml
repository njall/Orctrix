        title: The Role of the Sydney Gazette in the Creation of Australia in the Scottish Public Sphere
        doi: 10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.944593
        summary: Building upon my postgraduate research, I turned to a deeper analysis of Scottish journalism, namely the representations of colonial Australia in the early years of the nineteenth century. This article represents my first work on Scissors-and-Paste journalism.

        title: Scissors and Paste, Edges and Nodes
        doi: 10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.944593
        summary: Building upon the success of my research into representations of Australia, I wished to delve deeper into the networks that arose from Scissors-and-Paste practices. Institutional funding for training and equipment allowed me to develop new methodologies for determining not only reprinting, but directionality and branching within these networks.
