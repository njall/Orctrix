*Creating altmetric-informed narratives of your research*

## Purpose

Orctrix allows researchers to create rich narratives of their career and research trajectories by surrounding your publication and citation data in descriptive and visual context.

### Benefits

By wrapping your citations in narrative text, you can explore aspects of your work&mdash;its origins, aims, and pathways&mdash;that are not captured by traditional CVs. Moreover, it provides potentional collaborators, funders and employers with an intuitive and visually appealing introduction to you and your work.

## Requirements

To use Orctrix, you need only gather a few pieces of information

+ Your [ORCID&#174; iD](http://www.orchid.org)
+ Your institutional affiliation
+ A small narrative for each item you wish to include
+ The URLs of one or two images (120 x 120) for each item you wish to include
+ Your social media usernames for Facebook, Twitter and Github

## Output

Once processed, you will be provided a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)-powered webpage that you may include on your personal, insitutional or project website&mdash;wherever a narrative account of your work is needed!
